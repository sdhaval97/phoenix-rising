# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "phoenix-rising" project (also referenced as "breakfree" in the README). The repository is currently in its initial state with minimal setup.

## Current State

The repository contains:
- README.md with basic project name
- Git repository initialized with main branch
- No build system, dependencies, or configuration files established yet

## Development Setup

This project appears to be in the early initialization phase. No specific build, test, or development commands have been established yet. Future instances should work with the project owner to:

1. Determine the technology stack and framework
2. Set up appropriate build and development tooling
3. Establish testing frameworks and commands
4. Configure linting and formatting tools

## Architecture

The project architecture has not been established yet. This section should be updated once the project structure and technology choices are made.

## Notes for Future Development

- The project is a clean slate - no existing patterns or conventions to follow yet
- Technology stack decisions need to be made collaboratively with the project owner
- Standard development practices should be established based on the chosen technology stack

## Standard Workflow
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the [todo.md](http://todo.md/) file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
